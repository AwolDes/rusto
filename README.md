# rusto
Rusto is a simple ransomware implementation written in Rust.
It uses the AES Cipher to encrypt and decrypt files, and will eventually `POST` the secret key to a server.

## Why?
I wanted to learn Rust and enjoy learning and playing around with securty, so I thought it would be a fun project to learn a bit about both.

# Warning
Do not use this maliciously. I did it out of fun and to learn, please do the same.

## Use
To start using rusto run:

`cargo build`
`cargo run`
